Perl Support                                      *perl-support* *perlsupport*

                            Plug-in version 5.3.2
                        for Vim version 7.0 and above
                       Fritz Mehner  <mehner@fh-swf.de>

Perl Support implements a Perl-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably
speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by inserting
complete statements, comments, idioms, code snippets, templates, and POD
documentation.  Reading perldoc is integrated.  Syntax checking, running a
script, running perltidy,  running perlcritic, starting a debugger and a
profiler can be done with a keystroke.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++  The plug-in version 5.0+ is a rewriting of version 4.15+.               ++
++  The versions 5.0+ are based on a new and more powerful template system  ++
++  (please see |template-support|for more information).                    ++
++  The template syntax has changed!                                        ++

 How to add this help file to vim's help  |add-local-help|

==============================================================================
1.  USAGE WITH GUI  (gVim)                            *perlsupport-usage-gvim*
==============================================================================

 >>>  The root menu is not visible by default.  The root menu 'Perl' will
 >>>  appears after the first file with extension 'pl', 'pm', or 't' or with
 >>>  filetype 'perl' or 'pod' has been opened.

If the root menu 'Perl' is not visible you also can call it with the item
"Load Perl Support" from the standard Tools-menu.  The item "Unload Perl
Support" can be used to unload the Perl root menu. See|perlsupport-custom-root|.

Nearly all menu items insert code snippets or comments. All of these are
contained within template files and can be changed by the user to meet their
requirements (see|perlsupport-templates|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 MENU 'Comments'                                     *perlsupport-comments*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.1 APPEND ALIGNED COMMENTS TO CONSECUTIVE LINES  *perlsupport-aligned-comm*
--------------------------------------------------
In NORMAL MODE the menu item 'end-of-line comments' will append a comment to
the current line.

In VISUAL MODE this item will append aligned comments to all marked lines.
Marking the 3 lines
>
 my  $x11       = 11;
 my  $x1111     = 1111;

 my  $x11111111 = 11111111;
<
and choosing 'end-of-line comments' will yield
>
 my  $x11       = 11;                            # |
 my  $x1111     = 1111;                          #

 my  $x11111111 = 11111111;                      #
<
The cursor position above is marked by '|'. Empty lines will be ignored.

The default starting column is 49 ( = (multiple of 2,4, or 8) + 1 ).  This can
be changed by setting a global variable in the file .vimrc , e.g. :
>
  let g:Perl_LineEndCommColDefault    = 45
<
The starting column can also be set by the menu item 'Comments->adjust
end-of-line com.' . Just position the cursor in an arbitrary column (normal
mode; the column number is shown in the Vim status line) and choose this menu
item.  This setting is buffer related.
If the cursor was at the end of a line you will be asked for a column number
because this position is most likely not the desired starting column.
Your choice will be confirmed.

1.1.2  ADJUST END-OF-LINE COMMENTS                  *perlsupport-comm-realign*
----------------------------------
After some copy/paste/change actions comments may be misaligned:
>
 my  $x11   = 11;                                      # comment 1
 my  $x111  = 1111;                               # comment 2

 my  $x1111 = 11111111;                    # comment 3
<
Realignment can be achieved with the menu item 'adjust end-of-line com.' In
normal mode the comment (if any) in the current line will be aligned to the
end-of-line comment column (see above) if possible. In visual mode the
comments in the marked block will be aligned:
>
 my  $x11   = 11;                                # comment 1
 my  $x111  = 1111;                              # comment 2

 my  $x1111 = 11111111;                          # comment 3
<
The realignment function tries to interpret hash signs inside match and search
operators not as a start of a comment. This may not be perfect.

1.1.3  TOGGLE COMMENTS                               *perlsupport-comm-toggle*
----------------------
The comment sign # can be set or removed at the beginning of the current line
or for a marked block.  A single line needs not to be marked.

For marked block containing only lines with a '#' in the first column (and
possibly empty lines) all lines will be uncommented.

A marked block containing one or more nonempty lines without a '#' in the
first column will be changed into a comment block.

Whitespaces in front of the hash sign will be preserved.

1.1.4 COMMENT OUT A BLOCK OF CODE                     *perlsupport-comm-block*
---------------------------------
In normal mode the menu item 'comment block' inserts an empty POD block which
can be used like a C preprocessor directive for conditional compilation.
Statements inside will not be executed by the Perl interpreter.  This is
usually done to temporarily block out some code.
>
 =begin  BlockComment  # BlockCommentNo_1

 =end    BlockComment  # BlockCommentNo_1

 =cut
<
In visual mode a block of code like
>
   print "x11 = $x11\n";
   print "x22 = $x22\n";
<
will be surrounded by the above construct:
>
 =begin  BlockComment  # BlockCommentNo_2

   print "x11 = $x11\n";
   print "x22 = $x22\n";

 =end    BlockComment  # BlockCommentNo_2

 =cut
<
The label names like BlockCommentNo_2 are automatically inserted into the
comments.  The trailing numbers are automatically incremented if you apply the
command again.  These numbers can be changed by the user (both!).  The next
number will be one above the highest number found in the current buffer.  The
empty lines between the POD statements are necessary.

A corresponding label can be found by searching with the vim star command (*).
All labels can be found with a global search like :g/BlockCommentNo_/ or
:g/BlockCommentNo_\d\+/.

1.1.5 UNCOMMENT A BLOCK OF CODE                     *perlsupport-uncomm-block*
-------------------------------
The menu item 'uncomment block' removes such a construct if the cursor is
inside of such a block or on the line with '=begin ...'. Nested constructs
will be untouched.

1.1.6 FRAME COMMENTS, FILE HEADER, ...            *perlsupport-comm-templates*
--------------------------------------

Frame comments, subroutine descriptions and file header comments are read as
templates from the appropriate files (see |perlsupport-templates|).

1.1.7 KEYWORD COMMENTS                             *perlsupport-comm-keywords*
---------------------
Insert preliminary end-of-line comments to document (and find again) places
where work will be resumed shortly, like
>
   # :TODO:12.05.2011:Mn: <your comment>
<
Usually not meant for the final documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2  MENU 'Statements'                                *perlsupport-statements*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2.1  NORMAL MODE, INSERT MODE.                   *perlsupport-stat-norm-ins*
--------------------------------
An empty statement will be inserted and properly indented. The item 'if{}'
will insert an if-statement:
>
 if (  ) {
 }
<
1.2.2  VISUAL MODE.                                  *perlsupport-stat-visual*
-------------------
The highlighted area
>
 xxxxx
 xxxxx
<
can be surrounded by one of the following statements ( '|'
marks the cursor position after insertion):
>
  +----------------------------------------------------------+

The whole statement will be indented after insertion.  The foreach loop uses a
lexical iterator variable because Perl does this anyway.

1.3  MENU 'Idioms'                                        *perlsupport-idioms*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3.1  STUB SUBROUTINE                                  *perlsupport-stub-sub*
----------------------
In normal mode the item 'subroutine' asks for a subroutine name and creates a
stub subroutine with one parameter:
>
  sub xxx {
    my  ($par1) = @_;

    return ;
  } # ----------  end of subroutine xxx  ----------
<
In visual mode with a few lines marked this item will enclose these lines in
a subroutine and generate a call to this subroutine. The lines
>
  print "x11 = $x11\n";
  print "x22 = $x22\n";
  print "x33 = $x33\n";
<
will be changed into
>
  sub abc {
    my  ($par1) = @_;
    print "x11 = $x11\n";
    print "x22 = $x22\n";
    print "x33 = $x33\n";
    return ;
  } # ----------  end of subroutine abc  ----------
<
The further adaption is left to the user.

1.3.2  OPENING FILES                                  *perlsupport-open-files*
--------------------
All declarations beginning with 'my' and the multi-line statements (subroutine,
open input file / output file / pipe) will be inserted below the current line.
Everything else will be inserted at the cursor position.

The items 'open input file', 'open output file' and 'open pipe' ask for the
name of a file handle. The following lines will be inserted:
>
  my  $INFILE_file_name = '';     # input file name

  open  my $INFILE, '<', $INFILE_file_name
      or die  "$0 : failed to open  input file $INFILE_file_name : $!\n";


  close  $INFILE
      or warn "$0 : failed to close input file $INFILE_file_name : $!\n";
<
The menu items and hotkeys for opening a file or a pipe have a visual mode.
When a block is selected the code for opening a file/pipe will be inserted
above this block, the close statement will be inserted below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 MENU 'Snippets'                                *perlsupport-snippets-menu*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4.1  Code Snippets
--------------------
Code snippets are pieces of code which are kept in separate files in a special
directory. File names are used to identify the snippets.  The default snippet
is directory is $HOME/.vim/perl-support/codesnippets.  Snippets are managed
with the 4 items

   Perl -> Snippets -> read  code snippet
   Perl -> Snippets -> write code snippet
   Perl -> Snippets -> view code snippet
   Perl -> Snippets -> edit  code snippet

from the Snippets submenu.

Creating a new snippet:
-----------------------
When nothing is marked, "write code snippet" will write the whole buffer
to a snippet file. Otherwise the marked area will be written to a file.

Insert a snippet:
-----------------
Select the appropriate file from the snippet directory ("read code snippet").
The inserted lines will be indented.

Indentation / no indentation
----------------------------
Code snippets are normally indented after insertion. To suppress indentation
add the file extension "ni" or "noindent" to the snippet file name, e.g.
>
  parameter_handling.pl.noindent
<
There are some snippets belonging to this plug-in package. These are examples.
Add your own.

Snippet browser
---------------
Under a GUI a file requester will be put up. Without GUI the filename will be
read from the command line. You can change this behavior by setting a global
variable in your ~/.vimrc :
>
 let g:Perl_GuiSnippetBrowser = 'commandline'
<
The default value is 'gui'.


1.4.2  Code Templates                             *perlsupport-templates-menu*
---------------------
Nearly all menu items will insert code snippets or comments. All of these are
contained within template files and can be changed by the user to meet their
requirements (see|perlsupport-templates|on how to use the template system).

The menu item 'edit local templates' opens the main template file in the users
home directory. This is usually the file
'~/.vim/perl-support/templates/Templates'.  There may be dependent files
loaded from the main file.  Now change whatever file you want, save it, and
click on the menu item 'reread templates' to read in the file(s) and to
rebuild the internal representation of the templates.

Template browser
----------------
Under a GUI a file requester will be put up. Without GUI the filename will be
read from the command line. You can change this behavior by setting a global
variable in your ~/.vimrc :
>
 let g:Perl_GuiTemplateBrowser = 'explorer'
<
The default value is 'gui'. 'explorer' will start the file explorer
(see help|:Explore|). To use the command line assign 'commandline'.

Template Style
--------------
The template system supports different template styles. If there are more than
one style the menu item 'choose style' let you choose a style on the fly.

Template Jump Tags
------------------
You can use different jump tags in a template, e.g. {-tagname-}. The allowed
tags can be chosen from this menu.(see|perlsupport-templates-jumptags|)

Regex Template
--------------
Provides a minimal documentation for a regular expression stored as code
snippet in the code snippet directory (see|perlsupport-snippets-menu|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5  MENU 'Regex'                                          *perlsupport-regex*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5.1  COMPOSE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS                 *perlsupport-regex-compose*

----------------------------------
In NORMAL and INSERT MODE the shown items will be inserted at the cursor
position.

In VISUAL MODE the following items and all items from the 'extended Regex'
submenu will surround a marked area 'xxx' like this:

    ()    :      (xxx)
    (|)   :      (xxx|)
    []    :      [xxx]
    {}    :      {xxx}
    {,}   :      {xxx,}

1.5.2  EXPLAIN REGULAR EXPRESSION                  *perlsupport-regex-explain*
---------------------------------
If the Perl module YAPE::Regex::Explain is installed a regular expression
can be explained to you.
Just mark the expression (v-mode) and use the menu item 'explain Regex' or
the hotkey '\xe'.
You also can pick up a complete line containing a regular expression with the
menu item 'pick up regex' in normal mode. In this case leading and trailing
whitespaces will be removed.
Flags for the operator m/// can be picked up using the  menu item 'pick up
flags'.

The regular expression will now be explained in a new buffer called
'REGEX-EXPLAIN'. This buffer is not related  to a file and will not be
written, but the content can be printed with the hardcopy item in the
Run-menu. A regular expression can span several lines.
In order to use this feature you need a Vim binary with Perl interface
compiled in (see |perl|) and YAPE::Regex::Explain must be installed,  of
course.

1.5.3  MATCH                                         *perlsupport-regex-match*
------------
If you have a Vim binary with Perl interface compiled in (see |perl|) you can
test regular expressions very easily. This can be done in two ways.

1.5.3.1  VISUAL MODE                           *perlsupport-regex-visual-mode*
Pick up a regular expression by selecting the appropriate
string (v-mode; e.g.  inside the m// operator) and use the menu item 'pick up
regex'.  Pick up flags the same way with 'pick up flags'. Now pick up a string
as target with 'pick up string' and select the menu item 'match'. The regular
expression, the target and the match are shown in a new window called
REGEX-TEST:
>
  REGEXP = m{([\w\s]+)(jumped)(.{1,6})([\w\s]+)}

  STRING    [  0, 53] = ### The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. ###
  prematch  [  0,  3] = ###
  MATCH     [  3, 45] =   | The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog|
  postmatch [ 48,  5] =                                                 . ###

    $1      [  3, 21] =   | The quick brown fox |
    $2      [ 24,  6] =                         jumped
    $3      [ 30,  6] =                              | over |
    $4      [ 36, 12] =                                     the lazy dog
<
In addition the match will be highlighted in most cases. The match is done as
  $string =~ m{(?flags:$regexp)}
by the Perl interface. For the flags see|perlsupport-regex-flags|).
The brackets after a match object contain the starting position (starting
with 0) and the length of the object. Objects starting or ending with one or
more spaces are enclosed in vertical bars.

Multi-line regular expressions (like the string inside the braces below) are
allowed. They work properly if the flag 'x' is set.
>
  regexp     = m{ \d+
                  /   # a/b
                  \d+
                  }x
<
The most-recently-closed capturing parenthesis submatch ($^N) will be
displayed if it differs from the last parenthesized submatch ($+).
>
 REGEXP = m{(a|b)((a|b)(a|b))}

 STRING    [  0,  3] = aba
 MATCH     [  0,  3] = aba

   $1      [  0,  1] = a
   $2      [  1,  2] =  ba
   $3      [  1,  1] =  b
   $4      [  2,  1] =   a

   $^N         [  2] = ba
<
1.5.3.2  MULTI-LINE STRINGS                *perlsupport-regex-match-multiline*
Multi-line strings are also allowed.  The regular expression '(\n+)$' matches
consecutive line feeds at the end of a string or inside a string when used with
the flag 'm'.  The string in the following example consists of the 6 lines
from 'aaaa' to 'eeee'. The second, third, and fourth line contains 1 to 3
tabulators each (tab width is 2). The fifth line line is empty:
>
  aaaa
  bb  bb
  cc    cc
  dd      dd

  eeee
<
With the flag 'm' matching gives the following visualization:
>
  REGEXP = m{(\n+)$}m

  lines : 6           = |1.. |2... |3.... |4.....  |6..
  STRING    [  0, 32] = aaaa$bb~bb$cc~~cc$dd~~~dd$$eeee$
  prematch  [  0, 25] = aaaa$bb~bb$cc~~cc$dd~~~dd
  MATCH     [ 25,  1] =                          $
  postmatch [ 26,  6] =                           $eeee$

    $1      [ 25,  1] =                          $


  Control character replacement: \n -> '$'   \t -> '~'
<
The line feeds inside the string have been replace by dollar signs, the
tabulators have been replaced by the tilde. A ruler line will be shown. The
start of some lines are marked with the line number (depending on the line
length).
The control character replacements can be changed on the command line, e.g.:
>
  :RegexSubstitutions '# '
<
or by changing the defaults in the file '.vimrc'
>
  let g:Perl_PerlRegexSubstitution   = '# '
<
Line feeds will now be replaced by '#' (the first character of the given pair),
tabulators will be replaced by a space. Control characters are not allowed as
replacements.

1.5.3.3  MODIFIER g                             *perlsupport-regex-modifier-g*

The modifier 'g' can be used. The match operator
>
 m/(\d\d)/g
<
applied to the string
>
 'aaa 1234567890 BBB 123'
<
gives the following result:
>
 REGEXP = m{(\d\d)}g

 STRING    [  0, 22] = aaa 1234567890 BBB 123
 prematch  [  0, 19] =|aaa 1234567890 BBB |
 MATCH     [ 19,  2] =                    12
 postmatch [ 21,  1] =                      3

   $1      [ 19,  2] =                    12

   1.MATCH [  4,  2] =     12
   2.MATCH [  6,  2] =       34
   3.MATCH [  8,  2] =         56
   4.MATCH [ 10,  2] =           78
   5.MATCH [ 12,  2] =             90
   6.MATCH [ 19,  2] =                    12
<
The match is done in a loop. Prematch, match and postmatch belong to the last
match in this loop. All consecutive matches will be appended to the submatches
and the last code result.


1.5.3.4  NORMAL MODE                           *perlsupport-regex-normal-mode*
You can use a scratch buffer or a scratch area to test your
regular expressions. Just write the naked regular expression in one line and
the string on the next line:
>
  ([\w\s]+)(jumped)(.{1,6})([\w\s]+)
  ### The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. ###
<
Now select 'pick up regex', 'pick up string', and 'match' in normal mode
or use the hotkeys \xr, \xs, \xm and \xmm .
Leading and trailing whitespaces are removed from the regex and target string
if picked up in normal mode. If one of these strings has such whitespaces pick
it up in visual mode.

The picked up regular expression, the string, and the flags are kept in
internal variables. After a change you have just to renew the changed item.
The variable for the regular expression and for the flags is also used by the
menu item 'explain regex' (see|perlsupport-regex-explain|).

PICK UP FLAG(S)                                      *perlsupport-regex-flags*

The menu item 'pick up flag(s)' asks for one of the regular expression flags
'imsx' or any combination of them (hotkeys \xf ). You can also mark flags in
visual mode and pick the selection up. Characters other than the allowed flags
will be removed.

PICKING UP A MATCH OPERATOR m// WITH FLAGS

If a complete match operator (with flags, if any) is picked up, the plug-in
will try to seperate the regular expression and the flags from this line(s).
This form is often be found in the code and saves marking the flags as an
additional action.  The recognized flags and the regular expression will be
shown in a message. The following forms are allowed (flags are optional):
>
   /<regex>/<flags>    ?<regex>?<flags>
  m/<regex>/<flags>   m?<regex>?<flags>

  m<delimiter><regex><delimiter><flags>

  m{<regex>}<flags>
  m(<regex>)<flags>
  m[<regex>]<flags>
  m<<regex>><flags>
<
Multi-line expressions are also possible.


1.5.4  MATCH MULTIPLE                       *perlsupport-regex-match-multiple*
---------------------
If you have a Vim binary with Perl interface compiled in (see |perl|) you can
test several targets with several regular expressions:

(1) Pick up one or more marked lines with 'pick up regex' or with \xr.

(2) Pick up one or more target strings with 'pick up string' or \xs.

(3) Pick up flags (if any) the same way with 'pick up flags' or \xf.

(4) Select the menu item 'match multiple' or use \xmm.

The regular expressions, the targets and the matches are shown in a new window
called REGEX-TEST:
>

 1. REGEXP = m{^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,15}$}

   1         'abc123'
   2 <MATCH> 'BA99342bob'
   3         '1232z123311'
   4         'abcdef'
   5         '123456'
   6         '123'ABC'

   -----  matches: 1/6  -----

 2. REGEXP = m{^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-zA-Z])(?!.*[\W_\x7B-\xFF]).{6,15}$}

   1 <MATCH> 'abc123'
   2 <MATCH> 'BA99342bob'
   3 <MATCH> '1232z123311'
   4         'abcdef'
   5         '123456'
   6         '123'ABC'

   -----  matches: 3/6  -----
<
This example shows two password validator expressions tested against 6
passwords. The matches are marked.

The following rules apply:

 If several lines are selected as regular expression and the flag 'x' is set or
 found, this lines are used as one extented expression.

 If several lines are selected as targets and the flag 'm' is set or
 found, this lines are used as one multi-line target.


1.5.5  SUBMENU  'CharCls'                          *perlsupport-regex-charcls*
-------------------------
The items from this menus will be inserted at the cursor position.

1.5.6  SUBMENU  'Unicode property'             *perlsupport-regex-unicodeprop*
----------------------------------
The items from this menus will be inserted at the cursor position.

1.5.7  SUBMENU  'extended Regex'                       *perlsupport-regex-ext*
--------------------------------
The items from this menus will be inserted at the cursor position. The items
have an visual mode too. With 'bbb' marked in the line
>
  aaa bbb ccc
<
choosing the menu item '(?:...)' yields
>
  aaa (?:bbb) ccc
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6  MENU 'File-Tests'                                 *perlsupport-filetests*
1.7  MENU 'Spec-Var'                                   *perlsupport-specvar*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The items from these menus will be inserted at the cursor position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.8  MENU 'POD'                                              *perlsupport-pod*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most items insert POD commands below the cursor position, e.g.
>
  =pod



  =cut
<
The items 'POD->html', 'POD->man', 'POD->text' call the appropriate
translator which will generate the desired document from the current buffer.

The plug-in taglist.vim (Yegappan Lakshmanan) can be expanded for POD
navigation. See |perlsupport-custom-navigate|.

1.8.1  MENU 'invisible POD'                        *perlsupport-pod-invisible*
---------------------------
These menu items insert "invisible" POD sections as suggested in Damian
Conway's book "Perl Best Practices", e.g.
>
  =for Improvement: <keyword>
  <single paragraph>

  =cut
<
In visual mode these menu items will surround the marked block with the
appropriate construct. The '=for' line will be put before the first nonempty
line of the marked block.

The text in the single paragraph will be ignored by the compiler and by a POD
formatter. This can be used to embed extended pieces of internal
documentation. For the paragraph to be invisible there must not be an empty
line between =for ... and the following paragraph.

The four formatter names "Improvement", "Optimization", "Rationale", and
"Workaround" are just suggestions. You can choose additional ones.
The <keyword> is a short explanation which makes navigation with taglist
easier. See |perlsupport-custom-navigate|.
Please note the colon after the "formatter name". It is needed for parsing
this construct.

1.8.2  RUN PODCHECKER                                 *perlsupport-podchecker*
---------------------
The current buffer will be run through the application podchecker to check the
syntax of the embedded POD or of a POD format documentation file (see
podchecker(1) and Pod::Checker).
Podchecker always reports errors. Printing warnings can be turned on and off
with the options -warnings/-nowarning . The default is to print warnings.  To
turn the warnings off put the following line in the file .vimrc :
>
  let g:Perl_PodcheckerWarnings      = 'no'
<

1.8.3  RUN A POD TRANSLATOR                        *perlsupport-podtranslator*
---------------------------
Pod can be translated into a manual (using pod2man), a plain text file (using
pod2text), a html-page (using pod2html), or a PDF document (using pod2pdf).
Please see the dependency section (*perlsupport-dependencies* ) for details
about the translators.
The translation will go to the directory of the source file if this directory
is writable otherwise into the directory which is set in $HOME.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.9  MENU 'Run'                                              *perlsupport-run*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.9.1  RUN SCRIPT                                     *perlsupport-run-script*
-----------------
Run the script in the current buffer.  The output destination can be chosen
using the menu item 'Run->output: ...'.  There are 3 choices: VIM command
line, separate output buffer and xterm (see |perlsupport-output|).

1.9.2  CHECK SYNTAX                                 *perlsupport-syntax-check*
-------------------
The script is run as "perl -wc  xxx.pl" with most warnings enabled to check
the syntax.
For convenience consider to use maps like
>
  noremap  <silent> <F5>    :copen<CR>
  noremap  <silent> <F6>    :cclose<CR>
  noremap  <silent> <F7>    :cp<CR>
  noremap  <silent> <F8>    :cn<CR>
<
in your .vimrc file to jump to the error locations (F7,F8) and to open and
close the error window (F5,F6). This makes navigation a lot easier (see also
file 'customization.vimrc', |perlsupport-custom-files|).  The error list and
the error locations in your source buffer will be synchronized.

1.9.3  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS                       *perlsupport-cmdline-args*
-----------------------------
The item 'command line arguments' calls an input dialog which asks for
command line arguments. These arguments are forwarded to the script which
is run by the 'run' item. The arguments are kept until you change them.
The arguments can contain pipes and redirections, e.g.
>
 infile.txt | sort -rn > result.txt
<
For filenames and directories tab expansion can be used.

The arguments belong to the current buffer (that is, each buffer can have its
own arguments). The input dialog has a history. The ex command
>
 :PerlScriptArguments
<
can also be used to set the command line arguments.  If the buffer gets a new
name with "save as" the arguments will now belong to the buffer with the new
name.

1.9.4  PERL COMMAND LINE SWITCHES                  *perlsupport-perl-switches*
---------------------------------
The item 'perl switches' calls an input dialog which asks for command line
switches for the perl interpreter. These arguments are forwarded to the call
of the script which is run by the 'run' item. The switches are kept until you
change them. The ex command
>
 :PerlSwitches
<
can also be used to set the command line arguments for Perl.
The switches belong to the current buffer (that is, each buffer can have its
own independent switches). The input dialog has a history.

If the buffer gets a new name with "save as" the switches will now belong to
the buffer with the new name.

1.9.5  DEBUG                                           *perlsupport-run-debug*
------------
Start a debugger from the menu item Run->debug, with hotkey \rd or F9. One of
three debuggers can be started. The preference can be set with the variable
g:Perl_Debugger (possible values: 'perl', 'ptkdb', 'ddd' ). The default is
'perl').

(1) perl
The script will be run as 'perl -d my-script.pl my-arguments' in an xterm.
Perl switches set with \rw or from the menu will be used.

(2) ptkdb
The debugger ptkdb will be started as an independent process. ptkdb is a Perl
debugger using a Tk GUI. The module Devel::ptkdb and the Tk tool kit have to
be installed (see |perlsupport-dependencies|).

(3) ddd
The data display debugger ddd is a graphical front end for GDB (see
|perlsupport-dependencies|). It will be started as an independent process.
The debugger ddd is not available under MS-Windows.

The debugger starts in an separate xterm or is a separate GUI-application
(e.g. ddd).

Command line arguments (see |perlsupport-cmdline-args|) will be passed on to
the debugger.

Debugging without GUI
---------------------
The hotkey \rd or F9 can be used to start the debugger inside the vim window.
The script will be run with 'perl -d my-script.pl my-arguments'.

1.9.6  READ PERLDOC                                  *perlsupport-perldoc*
-------------------
If a (key-)word is under the cursor the item 'read perldoc' tries to look up
the Perl documentation for this word using perldoc.  If a whitespace is under
the cursor the user will be asked for a keyword.  Search order:
 1. modules     *-<-+
 2. functions   |   |
 3. FAQs        +->-+
This sequence is organized as a ring. If you search for the same item in the
module description (if any) again the plug-in tries to look up a function
description, then a FAQ and then the module description again.

On a UNIX platform errors produced by perldoc will be suppressed (a few
module descriptions have POD errors!).


1.9.7  GENERATE PERL MODULE LIST          *perlsupport-module-list-generation*
--------------------------------
The item 'Run -> generate Perl module list' generates a text file (default:
$HOME/.vim/perl-support/modules/perl-modules.list ) which contains one line
for each Perl module installed on your machine:
>
    ...
  Fcntl                        (1.05)    - load the C Fcntl.h defines
  File::Basename               (2.72)    - split a pathname into pieces
  File::CheckTree              (4.3)     - run many filetest checks on a tree
  File::Compare                (1.1003)  - Compare files or filehandles
  File::Copy                   (2.07)    - Copy files or filehandles
    ...
<
The module list is generated by the Perl script
$HOME/.vim/perl-support/modules/pmdesc3.pl (based on pmdesc2 by Aristotle, see
|perlsupport-credits| ).  This script has to be executable under UNIX. The
generation may take a while.  pmdesc3.pl has a POD included; see file
doc/pmdesc3.text .

1.9.8  SHOW INSTALLED PERL MODULES                  *perlsupport-module-list*
----------------------------------
The item 'Run -> show installed Perl modules' loads the module list in a new
window.  The full documentation for that module can be opened in a perldoc
help window using the hot keys <Shift-F1>, or \h.
Looking up help with Shift-F1 works also in the perldoc help window.
Vim (without GUI): only \h is working.

The module list can be folded (see |folding|). The Folding is defined by the
Perl package name separator '::'.

1.9.9  RUN PERLTIDY                                     *perlsupport-perltidy*
-------------------
The buffer can be formatted with perltidy. If nothing is marked the whole
buffer will be formatted. If a region is marked only this region will be
formatted. This can for instance be used for alignments. The 5 lines
>
 my  %hash   = (
     x => 111,
     xx => 22,
     xxx => 3
 );
<
become
>
 my %hash = (
     x   => 111,
     xx  => 22,
     xxx => 3
 );
<
Perltidy has a lot of options. It is recommended to use a .perltidyrc
initialization file to define the preferred style (see 'man 1 perltidy').
See also |perlsupport-troubleshooting|.

When using gVim you can mark a region of a non-Perl file to be processed by
perltidy by using the menu item 'Run->run perltidy'. This can be used to
format embedded Perl code.

Perltidy can be used as standard beautifier (commands "={motion}", see |=| )
by setting a global variable in the file .vimrc :
>
  let g:Perl_Perltidy  = 'on'
<
The default is 'off'.

Perltidy can empty your buffer completely in case of an error.  Setting a
global variable in the file .vimrc will write a backup file in the current
directory:
>
  let g:Perl_PerltidyBackup  = 'on'
<
The default is 'off'.


1.9.10  PROFILER                                        *perlsupport-profiler*
----------------

This plug-in is prepared to work with 3 profilers:

  Devel::SmallProf     - per-line Perl profiler
  Devel::FastProf      - "fast" per-line Perl profiler
  Devel::NYTProf       - Powerful feature-rich perl source code profiler

1.9.10.1  Devel::SmallProf                             *perlsupport-smallprof*
--------------------------
The menu item 'Profiler->SmallProf->run profiler' runs the profiler for the
script in the current buffer.  The results will go to the file smallprof.out
in the current directory. This file will be automatically loaded into a
quickfix buffer.

Devel::SmallProf (version 2.00_03) is controlled
by 4 variables (default values shown here):
>
 $DB::drop_zeros  = 0;           # Do not show lines which were never called: 1
 $DB::grep_format = 0;           # Output on a format similar to grep : 1
 $DB::profile     = 1;           # Turn off profiling for a time: 0
 %DB::packages    = ('main'=>1); # Only profile code in a certain package.
<
These variables can be put in a file called .smallprof in the current
directory. See the module documentation for more information.

Command line arguments (see |perlsupport-cmdline-args|) will be passed on to
the profiler.

Hot spot list in the QuickFix window
------------------------------------
The profiler will be run by the following command:

 SMALLPROF_CONFIG=gz perl -d:SmallProf <Perl script> [<arguments>]

The leading part of this command turns on the grep like format (g) and drops
lines which were never called (z). Point and click to go to the script hot
spots.

The report can be sorted using the criterion file-name, line-number,
line-count, time (wall time), ctime (cpu time) using the appropriate menu
item.

In the absence of menus (console mode) sorting is done with the command

 :SmallProfSort [ file-name | line-number | line-count | time | ctime ]

Use command completion. Type :Small<Tab> to complete the command name and
a blank and another <Tab> to list the criteria. The selection will be
highlighted.

Resorting the profiling statistics uses sort(1) and a temporary file.
Resorting is not available under MS-Windows.

Additional hint
---------------
Use the configuration file '.smallprof' to set the depth of the profiling,
e.g. with

 %DB::packages    = ('main'=>1);  # Only profile code in a certain package.

Please see the package documentation for more information.  The following
setting in the file '~/.vimrc' seems also to influence the statistics:
>
 "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 " The current directory is the directory of the file in the current window.
 "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 if has("autocmd")
   autocmd BufEnter * :lchdir %:p:h
 endif
<
Without this setting the report only includes the statistics for the file
profiled. With this setting the report includes the other modules used.

1.9.10.2  Devel::FastProf                               *perlsupport-fastprof*
-------------------------
The menu item 'Profiler->FastProf->run profiler' runs the profiler for the
script in the current buffer.  The results will go to the file fastprof.out in
the current directory. This file will be automatically loaded into a quickfix
buffer.

The report can be sorted using the criterion file-name, line-number, time,
line-count using the appropriate menu item.

In the absence of menus (console mode) sorting is done with the command

 :FastProfSort [ file-name | line-number | time | line-count ]

Use command completion. Type :Fast<Tab> to complete the command name and a
blank and another <Tab> to list the criteria. The selection will be
highlighted.
According to the documentation FastProf is not available for Windows.

1.9.10.3  Devel::NYTProf                                 *perlsupport-nytprof*
------------------------
The menu item 'Profiler->NYTProf->run profiler' runs the profiler for the
script in the current buffer.  The results will go to the subdirectory nytprof
below the current directory. The profiler generates HTML- and CSV-files
containing the results. Only the CSV-files can be loaded into the editor using
the item 'Profiler->NYTProf->read CSV file'.  The selected file will be
automatically loaded into a quickfix buffer.
An alternative way to open these files is the ex-command
>
 :NYTProfCSV
<
or using the hotkey \rpnc.

After the Return you are asked for a file (file browser or command line with
tab-expansion).

The report can be sorted using the criterion file-name, line-number, time,
calls, time/call using the appropriate menu item.

In the absence of menus (console mode) sorting is done with the command
>
 :NYTProfSort [ file-name | line-number | time | calls | time-call ]
<
Use command completion. Type :NYT<Tab> to complete the command name and
a blank and another <Tab> to list the criteria. The selection will be
highlighted.

Profiled library modules are opend as read-only copies in a temp directory.

The Devel::NYTProf profiler generates also HTML-files to be viewed with a
browser. To allow the generation of these files set a global variable in
the file '~/.vimrc' to 'yes' (default is 'no'):
>
  let g:Perl_NYTProf_html = 'yes'
<
The menu item 'Profiler->NYTProf->show HTML files' calls a viewer for the file
'nytprof/index.html'.  The default HTML-viewer is the konqueror. To change the
viewer set a global variable in the file '~/.vimrc', e.g.
>
  let g:Perl_NYTProf_browser = 'firefox'
<
The viewer can also be called from the command line:
>
 :NYTProfHTML
<
or using the hotkey \rpnh.

1.9.11 RUN PERLCRITIC                                 *perlsupport-perlcritic*
---------------------
"perlcritic" is a Perl source code analyzer (by Jeffrey Ryan Thalhammer;
search CPAN for the latest version; see also |perlsupport-dependencies|).
This excellent tool is the executable front-end to the Perl::Critic engine,
which attempts to identify awkward, hard to read, error-prone, or
unconventional constructs in your code.  Most of the rules are based on Damian
Conway's book Perl Best Practices (PBP).  When run from the menu the current
buffer will be saved and run through perlcritic. The reported violations will
be displayed in a separate quickfix error window.

Two perlcritic comand line options can be set by this plug-in:
 severity N  :  Directs perlcritic to only report violations of Policies with
                a severity greater than N.
 vebose   N  :  Sets the verbosity level for reporting violations.

SEVERITY
--------
Perlcritic  has 5 severity levels (perlcritic default level is 5).  This
plug-in sets the default level to 3.  This can be changed by setting the
variable g:Perl_PerlcriticSeverity in .vimrc to another value (1-5):
>
  let g:Perl_PerlcriticSeverity = 1
<
In addition there is an Ex command to do that, e.g.:
>
  :CriticSeverity 2
<
The severity names can also be used: gentle (=5), stern (=4), harsh (=3),
cruel (=2), brutal(=1).
A setting of the severity in a configuration file overrides the setting from
the menu or thee command line (see CONFIGURATION FILES below).

VERBOSITY
---------
Perlcritic  has 11 verbosity levels (default level is 4). Some levels are
equal except for the filename and are therefore treated equal because the
quickfix error system used by this plug-in needs a filename.  The message
format will not be exactly the same as from a command line execution of
perlcritic but the information displayed will be the same.  The reason lies in
some peculiarities of the quickfix error system used by Vim.

See the perlcritic documentation for details.

Verbosity 3 is the default.  This can be changed by setting the variable
g:Perl_PerlcriticVerbosity in .vimrc to another value (1-11):
>
  let g:Perl_PerlcriticVerbosity = 9
<
I addition there is an Ex command to do that, e.g.:
>
  :CriticVerbosity 9
<
A setting of the verbosity in a configuration file overrides the setting from
the menu or thee command line (see CONFIGURATION FILES below).

CONFIGURATION FILES
-------------------
The severity and verbosity setting will be taken from a configuration file
if such a file exists and contains lines like

  severity = 3
  verbose  = 4
A configuration file can be specified by the environment variable PERLCRITIC.
This plug-in looks next for the file '.perlcriticrc' in the local directory
and than for '.perlcriticrc' in the home directory. Please see the perlcritic
documentation for more.
If the severity or the verbosity level was taken from a configuration file the
filename will be reported after a perlcritic run.

OPTIONS
-------
There is another Ex command to set further options, e.g.
>
  :CriticOptions  -top 10
<
These options are put behind the severity and verbosity option. The actual
values are shown in the plug-in settings (|perlsupport-settings|). These
options can be reset with
>
  :CriticOptions
<
Settings done with CriticOptions override the settings by
g:Perl_PerlcriticOptions (if any).

The default configuration file for perlcritic is '.perlcriticrc'. perlcritic
will look for this file in the current directory first, and then in your home
directory.  See the manual for more information ('man perlcritic' or
'perlcritic -man') especially how to influence the policies.

For easier navigation in the error list see tip under
|perlsupport-syntax-check|.

1.9.12 SAVE BUFFER WITH TIMESTAMP                      *perlsupport-timestamp*
---------------------------------
Save the current buffer into a new file. The filename gets a trailing
timestamp.  The format is YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.  This corresponds to the default
time format is '%Y%m%d.%H%M%S' (see the manual page of the C function
strftime() for the format).  To change this put a different format into the
file ~/vimrc , e.g.
>
  let g:Perl_TimestampFormat= '%H%M%S.%d%m%y'
<
This feature can be used to comfortably save different profiling results but
it will work with any named buffer.

1.9.13 HARDCOPY                                         *perlsupport-hardcopy*
---------------
Generates a PostScript file from the whole buffer or from a marked region.  On
a MS-Windows system a printer dialog is displayed.
The hardcopy goes to the current working directory.  If the buffer contains
Perl documentation or other material from non-writable directories the
hardcopy goes to the HOME directory. The output destination will be shown in a
message.

The print header contains date and time for the current locale. The definition
used is
>
  let s:Perl_Printheader = "%<%f%h%m%<  %=%{strftime('%x %X')}     Page %N"
<
The current locale can be overwritten by changing the language, e.g.
>
  :language C
<
or by setting a global variable in the file .vimrc , e.g. :
>
  let g:Perl_Printheader = "%<%f%h%m%<  %=%{strftime('%x %X')}     SEITE %N"
<
See :h printheader and :h strftime()  for more details.

1.9.14 SETTINGS AND HOTKEYS                             *perlsupport-settings*
---------------------------
This menu item shows actual settings for the plug-in. Some of them can change
during a session (e.g. current output destination or perlcritic verbosity).

1.9.15 XTERM SIZE                                          *perlsupport-xterm*
-----------------
The size of the xterm used for debugging (|perlsupport-run-debug|) or for
running the script (below) can be set by this menu item. The default is 80
columns with 24 lines.
This feature is not available under MS-Windows.

1.9.16 CHANGE OUTPUT DESTINATION                          *perlsupport-output*
--------------------------------
Running a Perl script can be done in three ways:
(1) The script can be run from the command line as usual.
(2) The output can be directed into a window with name "Perl-Output".
    The buffer and its content will disappear when the window is closed and
    reused otherwise. If this window remains open it will be used for the next
    runs. If the script doesn't produce shell output the output window will
    not be opened (but you will see a message).
    There is no file behind the window Perl-Output but the content can be
    saved with a 'save as'.
(3) The script can be run in an xterm.

The output method can be chosen with the menu item 'Run->output: ...'.
This menu has three states:

  output: VIM->buffer->xterm
  output: BUFFER->xterm->vim
  output: XTERM->vim->buffer

The first (uppercase) item shows the current method.  The default is 'vim'.
This can be changed by setting the variable g:Perl_OutputGvim to another
value.  Possible values are 'vim', 'buffer' and 'xterm'.

Vim (non-GUI) : The output destination can be toggled between (1) and (2)
                using the hotkey \ro .

The xterm defaults can be set in .vimrc by the variable g:Perl_XtermDefaults .
The default is "-fa courier -fs 12 -geometry 80x24" :
  font name     : -fa courier
  font size     : -fs 12
  terminal size : -geometry 80x24
See 'xterm -help' for more options. Xterms are not available under MS-Windows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.10  Menu 'Tool Box'                                    *perlsupport-toolbox*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools which can be used by several plugins are located in the Tool Box.
Examples are tools for make(1) or doxygen.  The Tool Box has its own
documentation:|toolbox|.
To switch the Tool Box off add the following line to the file .vimrc
>
  let g:Perl_UseToolbox     = 'no'
<
1.10.1 Make                                         *perlsupport-toolbox-make*

The tool box for make provides a small set hotkeys, menu items, and ex commands 
for controlling make. Please see|toolbox-make|.
To switch the make tool box off add the following line to the file .vimrc
>
  let g:Perl_UseTool_make  = 'no'
<
The hotkeys for the make tool are defined in the file ~/.vim/ftplugin/perl.vim .

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.11  Menu 'help'                                           *perlsupport-help*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The root menu item 'help' (hotkey \hp ) shows this plug-in help in a help
window.  The help tags must have been generated with
>
  :helptags ~/.vim/doc
<
==============================================================================
2.  USAGE WITHOUT GUI  (Vim)                            *perlsupport-mappings*
==============================================================================

The frequently used constructs can be inserted with key mappings.  These
mappings are also described in the document perl-hot-keys.pdf (reference
card).

All mappings  are filetype specific: they are only defined for buffers with
filetype 'perl' to minimize conflicts with mappings from other plug-ins.

Some mappings can be used with range (of lines). In normal mode
>
  \cl
<
appends a end-of-line comment to the current line,  whereas
>
  4\cl
<
appends end-of-line comments to the 4 lines starting with the current line.

The file perl-hot-keys.pdf contains a reference card for these key mappings.
Multi-line inserts and code snippets will be indented after insertion.

The hot-keys are defined in the template files (part of this perl-support
plug-in package).

The mappings can also be used with gVim.

Changing the default map leader '\'
-----------------------------------
The map leader can be changed by the user by setting a global variable in the
file .vimrc
>
 let g:Perl_MapLeader  = ','
<
The map leader is now a comma. The 'line end comment' command is now defined
as ',cl'. This setting will be used as a so called local leader and influences
only files with filetype 'perl'.

The configured mapleader can also be used in the ftplugin, by calling the
functions *Perl_SetMapLeader()* and *Perl_ResetMapLeader()* . The maps created
between the two calls will use |g:Perl_MapLeader| as the |<LocalLeader>|:
>
  call Perl_SetMapLeader ()

  map  <buffer>  <LocalLeader>eg  :echo "Example Map :)"<CR>

  call Perl_ResetMapLeader ()
<

Resolving conflicts
-------------------
Sometimes the map leader '\' may conflict with Perl constructs e.g. when
typing an array reference: \@arrayname . There are three solutions.

(1) Typing speed matters. Type \ and wait some hundred milliseconds. The
following character will no longer be recognized as belonging to the backslash
as a map leader.

(2) Change the map leader for the filetype 'perl' as shown above.

(3) Change the map leader to another character, e.g. to the backtick with
      :let mapleader="`"
You can make this change permanent by adding this line to the file .vimrc .
CAVEAT: This setting is global and influences all filetypes.

==============================================================================
3.  FUNCTION KEYS                                  *perlsupport-function-keys*
==============================================================================

The following function keys are defined in normal, visual and insert mode:

   Shift-F1   read perldoc  (for the word under the cursor)
         F9   start a debugger
     Alt-F9   run syntax check
    Ctrl-F9   run script
   Shift-F9   set command line arguments (buffer related)

These function keys are defined in the file type plug-in ~/.vim/ftplugin/perl.vim .

Note for xterm users (Vim without GUI): The function key combinations
Shift-Fx, Alt-Fx and Ctrl-Fx do not work. F9 is also not working to prevent
unintentional use.  Use mappings instead (|perlsupport-mappings|).

4.3  THE ROOT MENU                                   *perlsupport-custom-root*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The root menu is not visible by default.  The root menu 'Perl' will appears
after the first file with extension 'pl', 'pm', or 't' or with filetype 'perl'
or 'pod' has been opened.
When the root menu is visible all templates have been loaded and the internal
data structures are built.  On a slow computer this may cause a noticeable
delay when starting the editor.  Therefor loading the templates is delayed to
the point where the first Perl file will be loaded.
To load the menu anyway when the editor starts add the following line to
~/.vimrc :
>
  let g:Perl_CreateMenusDelayed = 'no'
<
The variable g:Perl_Root, if set in .vimrc or in .gvimrc, gives the name of
the single gVim root menu item in which the Perl submenus are contained. The
default is
>
                  '&Perl.'
<
Please note the terminating dot.

If you want to set the plug-in root menu as a submenu into another menu, e.g.
your own with the name 'Plugin', this is done by the following line in
'.vimrc'
>
  let g:Perl_Root = '&Plugin.&Perl.'
<
The appearance of the root menu item can also be controlled by the global
variable g:Perl_LoadMenus. The line
>
  let g:Perl_LoadMenus    = 'no'
<
prevents the root menu item from appearing when the editor starts. You can
switch it on (and off again) from the tools menu. The default for this
variable is 'yes'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4  NAVIGATE THROUGH PODs                       *perlsupport-custom-navigate*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The plug-in taglist.vim (Author: Yegappan Lakshmanan) is a source code browser
plug-in for Vim and provides an overview of the structure of source code files
and allows you to efficiently browse through source code files for different
programming languages. It is based on  ctags (Exuberant Ctags, Darren Hiebert,
http://ctags.sourceforge.net).
The file rc/customization.ctags is an extension for the configuration file of
ctags.  If appended to $HOME/.ctags (the initialization file for ctags)
taglist can show the structure of the included POD as an table of content.

The taglist navigation window for the module Eliza.pm starts like this:
>
  Eliza.pm (/home/mehner)
    subroutines
      Version
      new
      _initialize
      AUTOLOAD
      command_interface
      preprocess
      postprocess
      _testquit
      _debug_memory
      transform
      parse_script_data

    POD
      NAME
      SYNOPSIS
      DESCRIPTION
      INSTALLATION
      USAGE
      MAIN DATA MEMBERS
      . %decomplist
      . %reasmblist
      . %reasmblist_for_memory
          . . .
<
Now you can navigate through the embedded POD with a mouse click on these
items. To enable this feature

 (1) append rc/customization.ctags to $HOME/.ctags (or create this file)

 (2) add the following lines to $HOME/.vimrc :
>
  "
  "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  " taglist.vim : toggle the taglist window
  " taglist.vim : define the title texts for Perl
  "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   noremap <silent> <F11>       :Tlist<CR>
  inoremap <silent> <F11>  <C-C>:Tlist<CR>

  let tlist_perl_settings   = 'perl;c:constants;f:formats;l:labels;p:packages;'.
                            \ 's:subroutines;d:subroutines;o:POD;t:Keyword Comments'
<
(3) restart vim/gvim

The two maps will toggle the taglist window (hotkey F11) in all editing modes.
The assignment defines the headings for the Perl sections in the taglist
window.

IMPORTANT : The POD contents will not be displayed if the POD comes after an
__END__ token. Ctags (current version 5.6) does not parse beyond this token.
You may therefore want not to use __END__ in your own modules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5  Tabulator width                                  *perlsupport-custom-tab*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Perl Style Guide recommends a tabulator setting of 4. The plugin forces
this setting for all files with file type 'perl' in the file type plug-in
'~/.vim/ftplugin/perl.vim':
>
  setlocal tabstop=4
  setlocal shiftwidth=4
<
This can be changed by the user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.6  System-wide installation (Unix/Linux only)      *perlsupport-system-wide*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fedora Linux: see below]


A system-wide installation (one installation for all users) is done as
follows.

As *** SUPERUSER *** :

(1) Find the Vim installation directory.
The Vim ex command ':echo $VIM' gives '/usr/local/share/vim' or something like
that. Beyond this directory you will find the Vim installation,  e.g. in
'/usr/local/share/vim/vim73' if Vim version 7.3 has been installed (Windows:
'C:\Program Files\Vim').

(2) Create a new subdirectory 'vimfiles', e.g. '/usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles'
(Windows: 'C:\Program Files\Vim\vimfiles').

(3) Install Perl Support
Copy the archive perl-support.zip to this new directory and unpack it:
>
  unzip perl-support.zip
<
(4) Generate the help tags:
>
  :helptags $VIM/vimfiles/doc
<
SPECIAL CASES. Some Linux distributions use non-standard names for Vim
directories. SUSE has a directory '/usr/share/vim/site' to put plug-ins in.
These directories will not be found automatically.  After installing the
plug-in below '/usr/share/vim/site' the use of the templates will be enabled by
the following line in '~/.vimrc':
>
  let g:Perl_GlobalTemplateFile = '/usr/share/vim/site/perl-support/templates/Templates'
<

As *** USER *** :

This plug-in will try to create your private template directory:

  ~/.vim/perl-support/templates

containing a minimal personal main template file 'Templates'.  You should set
some macros in this file with your personal information in order to obtain
personalized comments,  e.g. something like this:
>
 SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Dr. Fritz Mehner' )
 SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'fgm' )
 SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'mehner.fritz@fh-swf.de' )
 SetMacro( 'ORGANIZATION','FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn' )
 SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )
<
You can also have local templates which override the global ones. To see a
messages in this case set a global variable in '~/.vimrc' (Windows: '~\_vimrc'):

	let g:Templates_MapInUseWarn = 0

The default is '1'.
>
Create your private snippet directory:

  mkdir --parents  ~/.vim/perl-support/codesnippets

You may want to copy the snippets comming with this plug-in (in
$VIM/vimfiles/perl-support/codesnippets) into the new directory or to set a
link to the global directory.

----------------------------------------

Fedora Linux : perl-support is packaged for Fedora Linux and can be installed
system-wide by running "yum install vim-perl-support" command as root.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.7  Non-standard installation                      *perlsupport-non-standard*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The place of the code snippets is "$HOME/.vim/perl-support/codesnippets/".
For convenience this directory can be moved to another place. In this case the
new directory has to be specified in "$HOME/.vimrc":
>
 let g:Perl_CodeSnippets  = "/home/username/ ... /"
<
Please note the trailing slash.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.8  Use Perl6                                             *perlsupport-perl6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of Perl 6 (or another interpreter) can be enabled in two way.
The interpreter which runs ascript from inside Vim can be set globally
in ~/.vimrc by 
>
 let g:Perl_Perl	= '/usr/bin/perl6'
<
Drawback for the moment: syntax checking does not work.

Another way is to enable the execution on an (executable) script via shebang
by adding the following line to ~/.vimrc :
>
 let g:Perl_DirectRun  = 'yes'
<
Now a Perl6-script will be run via its first line, e.g.
>
 #!/usr/bin/env perl6 
<
all Perl5-scripts via their first line, e.g.
>
 #!/usr/bin/env perl 
<

==============================================================================
5.  TEMPLATE FILES AND TAGS                            *perlsupport-templates*
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1  TEMPLATE FILES                              *perlsupport-templates-files*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearly all menu items insert code snippets or comments. All of these are
contained within template files and can be changed by the user to meet their
requirements. The menu shortcuts (e.g. 'c' for the Comments menu) and the
menu item hotkeys (e.g. '\ct' insert date and time) are also defined in the
templates.
The template engine comes as a separate plug-in contributed by Wolfgang Mehner.
This section is a short introduction to this template system. Please see
|templatesupport.txt| for more information.

The master template file is '$HOME/.vim/perl-support/templates/Templates' for
a user installation and  '$VIM/vimfiles/perl-support/templates/Templates' for
a system-wide installation (see |perlsupport-system-wide|).

The master template file starts with a macro section followed by templates for
single menu items or better by including other template files grouping the
templates according to the menu structure of this plug-in. The master file
usually looks like this (my settings as an example):

Example:
>
 § ==========================================================
 §  User Macros
 § ==========================================================

 SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Dr. Fritz Mehner' )
 SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'fgm' )
 SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'mehner.fritz@fh-swf.de' )
 SetMacro( 'ORGANIZATION','FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn' )
 SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

 SetStyle( 'default' )

 § ==========================================================
 §  File Includes and Shortcuts
 § ==========================================================

 MenuShortcut( 'Comments',   'c' )
 MenuShortcut( 'Idioms',     'i' )
 MenuShortcut( 'Pod',        'd' )
 MenuShortcut( 'Statements', 's' )
 MenuShortcut( 'Special Variables', 'v' )
 MenuShortcut( 'Regex', 'r' )
 MenuShortcut( 'Snippets', 'n' )

 IncludeFile( 'comments.templates' )
 IncludeFile( 'idioms.templates' )
 IncludeFile( 'pod.templates' )
 IncludeFile( 'statements.templates' )
 IncludeFile( 'specvar.templates' )
 IncludeFile( 'regex.templates' )
 IncludeFile( 'snippets.templates' )
<
Lines starting with a section sign (§) are comments. The section starting with
>
  SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Dr. Fritz Mehner' )
<
assigns values to predefined tags (macros).  Arbitrary user-defined macros are
possible. The macro name must follows the rules for a C language identifier:
first character letter  or underscore; case matters; digits are allowed
beginning with the second character.

The statement
>
  IncludeFile( 'comments.templates' )
<
includes the templates from the file 'comments.templates' (in the same
directory). An absolute path would also be possible.  The statement
>
  MenuShortcut( 'Comments',      'c' )
<
sets 'c' as the shortcut for the Comments menu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2  MACROS                                     *perlsupport-templates-macros*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following macro names are predefined. The first group is used to
personalize templates.
>
 |BASENAME|        filename without path and suffix
 |DATE|            the preferred date representation for the current locale
                    without the time
 |FILENAME|        filename without path
 |PATH|            path without filename
 |SUFFIX|          filename suffix
 |TIME|            the preferred time representation for the current locale
                    without the date and the time zone or name or abbreviation
 |YEAR|            the year as a decimal number including the century
<
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PREDEFINED TAGS USED IN TEMPLATES
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <CURSOR>           The cursor position after insertion of a template.
 <+text+>,<-text->  See |perlsupport-templates-jumptags|.
 {+text+},{-text-}

 <SPLIT>            The split point when inserting in visual mode
                    (see|perlsupport-templates|)

A dependent template file can start with its own command section. There is no
need to have all user defined macros in the master file.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2.1   USER DEFINED FORMATS FOR DATE AND TIME    *perlsupport-templates-date*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The format for *|DATE|* ,*|TIME|* , and*|YEAR|* can be set by the user. The
defaults are
Example:
>
  |DATE|        '%x'
  |TIME|        '%X'
  |YEAR|        '%Y'
<
See the manual page of the C function strftime() for the format.  The accepted
format depends on your system, thus this is not portable!  The maximum length
of the result is 80 characters.

User defined formats can be set using the following function calls in the
master template file is '$HOME/.vim/perl-support/templates/Templates',  e.g.
>
  SetFormat( 'DATE', '%D'      )
  SetFormat( 'TIME', '%H:%M'   )
  SetFormat( 'YEAR', 'year %Y' )

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3  TEMPLATES                                   *perlsupport-templates-names*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3.1    Template definition                *perlsupport-templates-definition*
The template behind a menu item is identified by a given name. The first part
of the name identifies the menu name, the second part identifies the item.
A template definition starts with a template header with the following syntax:

  == menu_name.template_name == options ==

The options are described here: |template-support-options|.

5.3.2  The jump tags <+text+> etc.             *perlsupport-templates-jumptags*

There are four jump tag types which can be used as jump targets in templates:

 <+text+>   Can be jumped to by hitting Ctrl-j.
 {+text+}   Same as <+text+>. Used in cases where indentation gives unwanted
            results with the first one.

 <-text->   Same as the two above. Will be removed if the template is used
 {-text-}   in visual mode.

The text inside the brackets is userdefined and can be empty. The text can be
composed from letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores.
After the insertion of an template these jump targets will be highlighted.

5.3.3  Command Ctrl-j                                     *perlsupport-Ctrl-j*

Use the command Ctrl-j to jump to the next target. The target will be removed
and the mode will switched to insertion. Ctrl-j works in normal and in insert
mode.  The template for an if-else-statement can be written as follows:
>
  == Statements.if, else == map:sie, sc:i ==
  if <CURSOR>
    <SPLIT><-IF_PART->
  else
    <+ELSE_PART+>
  endif
<
The cursor will be set as shown. When the condition is specified a Ctrl-j let
you jump to the target <-IF PART-> and deletes it.  When the block is written
a Ctrl-j leads you to the else-part.  The target <+ELSE_PART+> disappears and
you can type on.

==============================================================================
6.  Perl::Tags                                          *perlsupport-perltags*
==============================================================================

The use of the module Perl::Tags (version >= 0.23; see CPAN) is encouraged.
In order to use this feature you need a Vim binary with Perl interface
compiled in (see |perlsupport-compile-vim|) and Perl::Tags must be installed,
of course.

Usage. If the cursor is on the module name in a perl 'use' ore 'require'
statement like
>
  use Graphics::GnuplotIF qw(GnuplotIF);
<
a CTRL-] let you jump into the file GnuplotIF.pm.  An easy way back is with
the CTRL-T command.  See also the module documentation on how to use
Perl::Tags.

The availability of Perl::Tags is automatically detected. To switch this
feature on put the following line into .vimrc :
>
  let g:Perl_PerlTags           = 'on'
<
The default value is 'off'.

==============================================================================
7.  PERL DICTIONARY                                   *perlsupport-dictionary*
==============================================================================

The file  perl.list  contains words used as dictionary for automatic word
completion.  This feature is enabled by default. The default word list is
>
  $HOME/.vim/perl-support/wordlists/perl.list
<
If you want to use an additional list MyPerl.List put the following line into
 .vimrc :
>
  let g:Perl_Dictionary_File   =  "$HOME/.vim/perl-support/wordlists/perl.list,".
                              \   "$HOME/any_of_my_directories/MyPerl.List"
<
The right side is a comma separated list of files. Note the point at the end
of the first line (string concatenation) and the backslash in front of the
second line (continuation line).
You can use Vim's dictionary feature CTRL-X, CTRL-K (and CTRL-P, CTRL-N).


==============================================================================
8.  OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES                           *perlsupport-dependencies*
==============================================================================

There are several optional dependencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1 Standard Perl modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These modules should come with your Perl distribution:

  perldoc    - Look up Perl documentation in Pod format
  pod2html   - convert .pod files to .html files
  pod2man    - Convert POD data to formatted *roff input
  pod2text   - Convert POD data to formatted ASCII text
  podchecker - check the syntax of POD format documentation files

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2 Non-standard Perl modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following modules have to be installed by the user/administrator in order
to use them.

  Devel::SmallProf     - per-line Perl profiler
  Devel::FastProf      - per-line Perl profiler
  Devel::NYTProf       - per-line Perl profiler
  Devel::ptkdb         - Perl debugger using a Tk GUI
  Perl::Critic         - Critique Perl source code for best-practices
  Perl::Tags           - Generate Ctags style tags for Perl source code
                         (see |perlsupport-perltags|)
  Perl::Tidy           - Parses and beautifies perl source
  Pod::Pdf             - A POD to PDF translator
  YAPE::Regex::Explain - regular expression analyzer

This is done in one of two way:

(1) Download the tarball from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/) or one of its
mirrors, go to the new directory, read the files README and INSTALL, and
follow the instructions. You have to resolve the dependencies yourself
by first installing them.

(2) Install the cpan shell (module CPAN) and install modules via network.
The dependencies are resolved automatically. Recommended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.3 Other applications
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ddd - The Data Display Debugger (graphical front-end for GDB)

The homepage of this project is http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/.

==============================================================================
9.  Compiling Vim                                    *perlsupport-compile-vim*
==============================================================================

You may want to compile Vim yourself because the 'perl' feature is missing.
First, there are two ways to check this:
(1) Type 'version' on the Vim command line and look for 'perl' in the section
"Features includes ... ".
(2) Type 'echo has("perl")' on the Vim command line. If you get a '0' the
feature is not present.
A ':help :version' will show all possible features to choose from.

You could first look around for a binary distribution with this feature which
was compiled for your platform. Install it and all is done.

COMPILE YOUR OWN VERSION (LINUX/UNIX).
--------------------------------------
(1) Download the sources from http://vim.sourceforge.net/ and extract the
sources from the archive (for patches see|perlsupport-compile-vim-patches|).

(2) Inspect the current version again. The section 'Compilation' shows how
this version was built. You can see the libraries used. In order to have your
new version looking like the one you are just using you may have to install
some additional libraries first (the development versions).

(3) Change to the directory containing the source code and type
>
	./configure --enable-gui=gtk2 --enable-perlinterp=yes
<
or
>
	./configure --enable-gui=gtk2 --enable-perlinterp=dynamic
<
for Perl and your favorite GUI (here GTK). With 'dynamic' the Perl library
will be loaded only when needed.

(4) Make the binary the traditional way:
      make
      make test
      make install  (you must be root)
You may want to install patches before the first make.

A './configure --help' prior to these steps will show a lot of options (e.g.
for a local or user installation).

(5) Check if you have to add the target directory for the new installation to
PATH.

(6) Check if the new version starts up when you are in your normal working
environment. You may have to remove the old version to avoid conflicts.

The file 'src/INSTALL' contains more details if needed.

PATCHES                                      *perlsupport-compile-vim-patches*
-------
Before compiling your own version you may want to include the patches from
ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/. The patch directory contains a file 'README'
which shows how to do that.

==============================================================================
10.  FOLDING                                             *perlsupport-folding*
==============================================================================

This plug-in can be used together with folding.

There are a few peculiarities when the cursor is on a closed fold before
inserting a template:

Normal mode
-----------
Inserting blocks of complete lines below and above a fold (e.g. frame
comments) and inserting at the top of a buffer (e.g. file description) works
as usual.
Insertions which go to the end of a line (e.g. end-of-line comments) and
insertions which go to the cursor position (e.g. 'date') will be suppressed
and a warning will be shown.

Visual mode
-----------
A range of lines containing closed folds can be surrounded by constructs which
have a visual mode, e.g. an if-statement:
>
         if ( $check==0 ) {
  +---  5 lines: open  my $ss, '<', $ss_file_name----------------------------
         }
<
See |folding| for more information on folding.

==============================================================================
11.  Additional Mappings                             *perlsupport-ad-mappings*
==============================================================================

There are a few additional filetype specific key mappings defined in
'~/.vim/ftplugin/perl.vim'.

Open a block (modes: i,v):
>
  '{<CR>' =>  {
                |
              }
<
In visual mode the content of the new block will be indented.

==============================================================================
12.  AUTOLOADING                                        *perlsupport-autoload*
==============================================================================

The this perlsupport plug-in uses the Vim autoload mechanism to load parts of
the plug-in at the latest possible time.

The main part '~/.vim/plugin/perl-support.vim' will always be loaded at
startup in console mode (Vim) and graphical mode (gVim).

The filetype plug-in '~/.vim/ftplugin/perl.vim' (hotkey) will be loaded when a
file of type 'perl' has been opened.

The file '~/.vim/autoload/perlsupportregex.vim'  will be loaded when the
regular expression analyzer has been called (hotkey or menu item).

==============================================================================
13.  MS-Windows PARTICULARITIES                          *perlsupport-windows*
==============================================================================

For a user installation the plug-in should go into the directory structure below
  $HOME/vimfiles/
for a system installation below
  $VIM/vimfiles/

The values of the two variables can be found from inside Vim:
   :echo $VIM
or
   :echo $HOME

The configuration files for a user are

  $HOME/_vimrc   and  $HOME/_gvimrc

for the system

  $VIM/_vimrc   and  $VIM/_gvimrc

==============================================================================
14.  TROUBLESHOOTING                             *perlsupport-troubleshooting*
==============================================================================

* I do not see any new main menu item.
  - Was the archive extracted into the right directory (see |perlsupport-windows|)?

* How can I see what was loaded?
  - Use ':scriptnames' from the Vim command line.

* Perl script not executable from inside the editor.
  - Script executable from the command line ?
  - Perl installation correct ?
  - PATH variable correct ?
  - Script set executable (file access permission under LINUX/UNIX) ?
  - Script syntax correct ?
  - Necessary modules installed ?

* Some hotkeys (e.g. x-F9) do not work.
  - The hotkeys might be in use by your graphical desktop environment.
    Under KDE Ctrl-F9 is the hotkey which let you switch to the 9. desktop.
    The key settings can usually be redefined or switched off.
    Under KDE, 'Keyboard Shortcuts' may be configured by following:
     K Menu -> Control Center -> Regional & Accessibility -> Keyboard Shortcuts.

* perltidy not running / messing up my file
  Unix/Linux: you have had a proper installation of perltidy, but now it does
  not work or messes up your file.
  The start script '/usr/bin/perltidy' needs the module 'Perl::Tidy.pm'. Most
  likely you have updated Perl and the module can not longer be found. The
  easiest remedy is to reinstall perltidy. Check the installation with the
  command "perltidy -v" from the command line.
