This plugin will automatically load cscope.out databases into vim when you open a C file. (headers included)

It does a search starting at the directory that the file is in, and checking the parent directories until it find the cscope.out file.  The idea being that you can start editing a source file deep in a project dir, and it will find the correct cscope database a couple dirs up.

This version also creates some macros and a menu that can be useful.  If you don't like them, you can set g:autocscope_menus to 0 and they won't load.
